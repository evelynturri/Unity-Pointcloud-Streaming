# UnityPointCloudStreaming
Project developed in collaboration with other two students which aims at analyzing feasibility and implementing strategies to perform low latency streaming of point cloud data over the internet using Unity and Stereolabs ZED camera. We proposed several solutions trying to reach this goal.
